# Into the Breach - Translations
Inofficial Translations for PC Game Into the Breach. This is all fan made. You can help translating this game into your language. If used, it does directly modify some game files.

Until now, a complete translation file for one language contains more than 2000 lines of text. When all keys are included it grows up to 4000+. A huge job that really take some time and that demands your stamina.

## General Status
* Text-file based translation keys are complete, somewhat, and ready for translation
* The fonts of the game don't support most of special chars in other languages, a fix is probably to modify the included game fonts
* Hardcoded image translations are not changable by this tool as it requires to modify images directly out of game resources
